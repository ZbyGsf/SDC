**Date: 2025-03-21**  
We have provided all source code, but it remains disorganized and requires further refactoring.
The code includes the core functionality and server-side configuration.

**Date: 2025-04-08**  
(1) We have added two new folders: local and online.  
(2) The local section contains code related to training deep learning models.  
(3) The online section includes code for server deployment.  
(4) We have temporarily supplemented the code in the online section, while the local section is still being organized.
